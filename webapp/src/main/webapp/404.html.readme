The 404.html file is listed in the .htaccess file.

The goal of this file is to provide 404 error page for people using a front-end proxy/router in front of JHipster (for
example, an Apache HTTP server, this is why the .htaccess file is here).

If JHipster is down, then this front-end can still show the errors correctly, using those files.
